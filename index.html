                    If you are curious about science, especially physics, you have to start doing science, particularly in the field of physics. I am currently studying gravity through the lens of holography. When I refer to holography, I mean the concept of a holographic universe. Specifically, I am engaged in Celestial Holography within an Asymptotically Flat Spacetime. Before delving into the depths of my research area, I would like to provide some motivations. I will do this by posing some fundamental questions and providing corresponding answers.
                   </p>
                    <h1 style="font-size: 15px; color: yellowgreen;"><strong>What is Asymptotically flat spacetime and what are the symmetries?</strong></h1>
                    <p>
                        It refers to a type of spacetime geometry in which the curvature of spacetime becomes infinitely small at infinite distances from any massive objects. As we know symmetries are the transformations of fields that leave the physical observables invariant. In this sense asymptotic symmetries exist in the physical systems far away from the gravitational systems.

                    <h1 style="font-size: 15px; color: yellowgreen;"><strong>What is Celestial Holography?</strong></h1>
                   <p>The holographic principle proposes that the dynamics of a gravitational system in a certain number of spacetime dimensions can be described by a lower-dimensional theory without gravity living on its boundary. This concept is primarily by Juan Maldacena in terms of AdS/CFT Correspondence in which a particular kind of quantum field theory called Conformal Field theory (CFT) emerged out of the gravity in curved anti-de Sitter (AdS) space whose boundary is a cylinder. However, Our Universe is unlike this. It's asymptotically flat spacetime. In the case of Celestial Holography, the boundary in question is a null hypersurface that represents the celestial sphere of the gravitational system, and the CFT we do on the spherical boundary is called Celestial CFT (CCFT). Now is the time we call ourselves as the Celestial Holographers (Physicists working in this field of Celestial Holography).

                  The direct detection of the gravitational waves set up a platform for the scientific community in Gravitational Wave Astronomy to investigate different aspects of gravity theories. One of the major physical effect called as Gravitational Memory effect. This will help us in understanding the properties of black hole spacetimes and gravitational waves. The peak sensitivity of <a href= "https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/">LIGO </a> and <a href= "https://lisa.nasa.gov/">LISA </a> detectors might capture the effect of memory's rise time during the merger and ringdown phases of a Binary Blackhole(BBH). In this direction there have been several implications of GW memory detection in GW150914 through LIGO detector.</p>

            <h1 style="font-size: 15px; color: yellowgreen;"><strong>Why is this important and how is it related to the Asymptotic symmetries?</strong></h1>
              <p>The passage of gravitational waves produces a permanent shift in the relative positions of a pair of inertial detectors. This effect is called Memory effect. Theoretically this classical observable effect can be related to the quantum effects like soft theorems and the asymptotic symmetries. I will briefly explain these two quantum phenomena. This can be easily visible in the diagramatically interpretation of <a href= "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.05448.pdf">Strominger's IR triangle</a>:

  <li>One of the primary way to probe the fundamental forces of nature is to study Scattering processes. Here we want to understand the quantum gravitational scattering problems in the low energy regime and Soft theorems are the symmetry constraints of the scattering amplitudes in this low energy regime. This is basically the low energy sector of a scattering process. When we have a scattering process, there are external particles of different energy scales. Now when we make one of the energy of the external particles to zero then we call that particle to be soft particle. But the question is, what's the need to do that? The answer is, in our observable universe the asymptotic observer always sits at the infinities of the spacetime. Which means at the asymptotic boundaries of the spacetime. Hence the information flow will only be possible via the messengers (which is photons in case of electromagnetic interaction in terms of Electromagnetic Waves and gravitons in case of Gravitational interaction in terms of Gravitational Waves). So the soft particles in our case are photons and gravitons. When we study one scattering process we need to find the scattering amplitude. After taking one of the particles to be soft we can write this higher point amplitude in terms of a lower point amplitude multiplied by the universal soft factor. This is one incredible result from the Amplitude community because this theorem is independent of the theory we consider, the structure will be independent of the scattering informations. Isn't this cool!!:)</li>
  <li>The infinite symmetries of the four dimensional asymptotically flat spacetime in both gauge and gravity theories leads us to the triangular relation between memory effect, asymptotic symmetries and soft theorems. Due to the passage of a gravitational radiation, the difference in the initial and final geometries of the spacetime is related by a BMS supertranslation. The Ward identities of this invariance in Quantum Gravity(QG) are expressed as data representing gravitational radiation at null infinity. The recent uncovering of the relation between the on-shell physics of asymptotically flat theories and 2D CFT has proved to be a powerfull tool. The boundary physics is captured by a 2D CFT(CCFT) of the conformal operators on the Celestial Sphere. Celestial amplitudes are of immense importance as an independent entity in itself. The infinite number of symmetries impose constraints on the celestial amplitude via Ward identities which give us the soft theorems. These constraints directly imply constraints on the bulk scattering amplitude. Hence a thorough understanding of celestial amplitudes can uncover new symmetries.</li>
</ul>

              
            <p> In my recent works which you can find in <a href=" https://inspirehep.net/authors/1955844">my INSPIRE profile</a>, we used the Celestial Conformal Field Theory (CCFT) formalism to find the asymptotic symmetries algebras of the bosonic theories Einstein-Yang-Mills and Einstein-Maxwells in (3+1) dimension along with in maximally supersymmetric N=8 Supergravity theory. The disjoint study of gravitational memory and asymptotic symmetries will give us more evidences on the general theory of relativity and help us explore far in the past and future. </p>
            <p>For a general knowledge regarding the holography, I recommend one <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/symmetries-reveal-clues-about-the-holographic-universe-20220112/">QuantaMagazine</a> article, how symmetries will help us explore the holographic universe. People can follow the references there itself in the article.</p>

                Now here I will highlight my second result which is totally dedicated to Double copy formalism. I will highlight this result on behalf of the works by the group Jan Plefka and Zvi Bern. They studied this formalism on behalf of Gravitational Physics and they did use the formalism in case of gravitational scattering matrix. Then I will motivate my readers to Gravitational physics and its discovery and future goals. I wonder whether people will get engaged with my readings considering the advancement in this subject area. I am highly motivated in this direction and I wish my readers to feel the same as well. One my friend is an active researcher in this field of research, where they study the EFT methods to find the higher order PN corrections to Binary mergers. I am right now interested in the similar direction, not in particular. However in EOB and PN-PM approximation techniques. Recently I discovered one new field of line which is dedicated to Worldline quantum field theory. Now I have to learn this technique to understand how classical double copy relation is applied in case of World line quantum field theory. These are the works from Zvi Bern's group. They mostly work opposite to the work my friend does. They are computing the results based on the quantum field theory. Withing a month I have to learn this technique and include this in

              Keep it up with the website for fun and add some youtube channels in the PROBE section of the website. 
              There is something on the MUSICAL Path Integral in the blog for this month. Have to work on that too. 
              Let's start something here itself:
              Musics- Everybody is familiar with is this. But what is path integral? People apart from the physics community are not familiar to this terminologies. It;s interesting to mix up or you can say have a collaboration between these two woldwide popular fields. Seems to have fun!!
              Path integral has some technicalities associated with it. Mostly in physics. Discovered by Richard Feynman and introduced to the great community of Physics and solved many unsolved problems of physics using this particular path integral formalism. This is and intro to path integral formulation. I'll introduce something more on this part later. But now I'll let you know, why do I even think of having some relation between these two disjoint fields? Cool!! -->
