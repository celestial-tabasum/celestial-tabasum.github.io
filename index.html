                          <p>  If an individual possesses a strong intellectual curiosity, particularly within the domain of science, it is imperative to initiate a path of scientific exploration. Research in science in not about solving the unsolved, it's all about observation. </p>

                          <p>  I am currently studying gravity through the lens of holography. Specifically, I am engaged in Celestial Holography. Here I will explain briefly my field of research and list my research publications for reference.

                    <!-- <h1 style="font-size: 15px; color: yellowgreen;"><strong>What is Celestial Holography?</strong></h1> -->
                   <p>Generically, the holographic principle proposes that the dynamics of a gravitational system in a certain number of spacetime dimensions can be described by a lower-dimensional theory without gravity living on its boundary. This concept is primarily introduced by Juan Maldacena in terms of AdS/CFT Correspondence in which a particular kind of quantum field theory called Conformal Field theory (CFT) emerged out of the gravity in curved anti-de Sitter (AdS) space whose boundary is a cylinder. However, unlike this our universe is asymptotically flat. </p>


<p> In particular, Celestial Holography descibes the physics of a four-dimensional asymptotically flat Minkowski spacetime in terms of the boundary quantum field theory. The bulk spacetime can be described in terms of the compactified Penrose diagram where the boundaries are null hypersurfaces with a sphere sitting at each point. In otherwords we can simply look at the sky to understand what is happening inside this four-dimensional world that we live in. This compactified spacetime preserves the conformal symmetry of the spacetime and in this regard we call the field theory on the sky of the spacetime to be Celestial Conformal Field Theory (CCFT), introduced by Strominger in 2017.</p>


                  

                    <!-- <p>In the case of Celestial Holography, the boundary in question is a null hypersurface that represents the celestial sphere of the gravitational system, and the CFT we do on the spherical boundary is called Celestial CFT (CCFT).</p> -->

            <p> In my recent works, we used the Celestial Conformal Field Theory (CCFT) formalism to find the asymptotic symmetries algebras of gauge theory coupled to graivty like Einstein-Yang-Mills and Einstein-Maxwells in (3+1) dimension. Along with we have explored more in the supersymmetric sector liket that in maximally supersymmetric N=8 Supergravity theory. The disjoint study of gravitational memory and asymptotic symmetries will give us more insights on the general theory of relativity and help us explore far in the past and future. </p>

                Now here I will highlight my second result which is totally dedicated to Double copy formalism. I will highlight this result on behalf of the works by the group Jan Plefka and Zvi Bern. They studied this formalism on behalf of Gravitational Physics and they did use the formalism in case of gravitational scattering matrix. Then I will motivate my readers to Gravitational physics and its discovery and future goals. I wonder whether people will get engaged with my readings considering the advancement in this subject area. I am highly motivated in this direction and I wish my readers to feel the same as well. One my friend is an active researcher in this field of research, where they study the EFT methods to find the higher order PN corrections to Binary mergers. I am right now interested in the similar direction, not in particular. However in EOB and PN-PM approximation techniques. Recently I discovered one new field of line which is dedicated to Worldline quantum field theory. Now I have to learn this technique to understand how classical double copy relation is applied in case of World line quantum field theory. These are the works from Zvi Bern's group. They mostly work opposite to the work my friend does. They are computing the results based on the quantum field theory. Withing a month I have to learn this technique and include this in

              There is something on the MUSICAL Path Integral in the blog for this month. Have to work on that too. 
              Let's start something here itself:
              Musics- Everybody is familiar with is this. But what is path integral? People apart from the physics community are not familiar to this terminologies. It;s interesting to mix up or you can say have a collaboration between these two woldwide popular fields. Seems to have fun!!
              Path integral has some technicalities associated with it. Mostly in physics. Discovered by Richard Feynman and introduced to the great community of Physics and solved many unsolved problems of physics using this particular path integral formalism. This is and intro to path integral formulation. I'll introduce something more on this part later. But now I'll let you know, why do I even think of having some relation between these two disjoint fields? Cool!! -->

        <p>
                  Direct detection of the gravitational waves set up a platform for the scientific community in Gravitational Wave Astronomy to investigate different aspects of gravity theories. One of the significant physical effects is called as Gravitational Memory effect. This will help us understand the properties of black hole spacetimes and gravitational waves. The peak sensitivity of <a href= "https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/">LIGO </a> and <a href= "https://lisa.nasa.gov/">LISA </a> detectors might capture the effect of memory's rise time during the merger and ringdown phases of a Binary Blackhole (BBH). In this direction, GW memory detection has had several implications in GW150914 through the LIGO detector.
</p>
        

            <h1 style="font-size: 18px; color: white;"><strong><i>Solving the Spacetime Riddle...</i></strong></h1>

                    <p>
                        Asymptotically flat spacetimes refers to a type of spacetime geometry in which the curvature of spacetime becomes infinitely small at infinite distances from any massive objects. As we know symmetries are the transformations of fields that leave the physical observables invariant. In this sense asymptotic symmetries exist in the physical systems far away from the gravitational systems.

                    </p>
              <p>The passage of gravitational waves produces a permanent shift in the relative positions of a pair of inertial detectors. This effect is called Memory effect. Theoretically, this classical observable effect can be related to the quantum effects like soft theorems and the asymptotic symmetries. I will briefly explain these two quantum phenomena. This can be easily visible in the diagramatical interpretation of <a href= "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.05448.pdf">Strominger's IR triangle</a>.

 One primary way to probe nature's fundamental forces is to study Scattering processes. Here we want to understand the quantum gravitational scattering problems in the low energy regime. Soft theorems are the symmetry constraints of the scattering amplitudes in this regime. This is basically the low-energy sector of a scattering process. When we have a scattering process, there exist  external particles of different energy scales. When we set the energy of one of the external particles to zero, we call that particle a soft particle. But the question is, what's the need to do that? In our observable universe, the asymptotic observer always sits at the infinities of the spacetime, which means at the asymptotic boundaries of the spacetime. Hence the information flow will only be possible via the messengers (which are photons in case of electromagnetic interaction of Electromagnetic Waves and gravitons in case of Gravitational interaction of Gravitational Waves). So the soft particles, in our case, are photons and gravitons. When we study one scattering process, we need to find the scattering amplitude. After taking one of the particles to be soft, we can write this higher point amplitude as a lower point amplitude multiplied by the universal soft factor. This is one incredible result from the Amplitude community because this theorem is independent of the theory we consider; the structure will be independent of the scattering pieces of information. Isn't this cool!! :)</p>
  <p>The infinite symmetries of the four-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetime in both gauge and gravity theories lead us to the triangular relation between the memory effect, asymptotic symmetries, and soft theorems. Due to the passage of gravitational radiation, the difference in the initial and final spacetime geometries is related by a BMS supertranslation. The Ward identities of this invariance in Quantum Gravity (QG) are expressed as data representing gravitational radiation at null infinity. The recent uncovering of the relation between the on-shell physics of asymptotically flat theories and 2D CFT has proved to be a powerful tool. The boundary physics is captured by a 2D CFT (CCFT) of the conformal operators on the Celestial Sphere. Celestial amplitudes are of immense importance as an independent entity in itself. The infinite number of symmetries impose constraints on the celestial amplitude via Ward identities giving us the soft theorems. These constraints directly imply constraints on the bulk scattering amplitude. Hence a thorough understanding of celestial amplitudes can uncover new symmetries.

                Now here I will highlight my second result which is totally dedicated to Double copy formalism. I will highlight this result on behalf of the works by the group Jan Plefka and Zvi Bern. They studied this formalism on behalf of Gravitational Physics and they did use the formalism in case of gravitational scattering matrix. Then I will motivate my readers to Gravitational physics and its discovery and future goals. I wonder whether people will get engaged with my readings considering the advancement in this subject area. I am highly motivated in this direction and I wish my readers to feel the same as well. One my friend is an active researcher in this field of research, where they study the EFT methods to find the higher order PN corrections to Binary mergers. I am right now interested in the similar direction, not in particular. However in EOB and PN-PM approximation techniques. Recently I discovered one new field of line which is dedicated to Worldline quantum field theory. Now I have to learn this technique to understand how classical double copy relation is applied in case of World line quantum field theory. These are the works from Zvi Bern's group. They mostly work opposite to the work my friend does. They are computing the results based on the quantum field theory. Withing a month I have to learn this technique and include this in

              <!-- There is something more regarding my research here on Memory effect and I also can add some references for the understanding and for fun also.
              Keep it up with the website for fun and add some youtube channels in the PROBE section of the website. 
              There is something on the MUSICAL Path Integral in the blog for this month. Have to work on that too. 
              Let's start something here itself:
              Musics- Everybody is familiar with is this. But what is path integral? People apart from the physics community are not familiar to this terminologies. It;s interesting to mix up or you can say have a collaboration between these two woldwide popular fields. Seems to have fun!!
              Path integral has some technicalities associated with it. Mostly in physics. Discovered by Richard Feynman and introduced to the great community of Physics and solved many unsolved problems of physics using this particular path integral formalism. This is and intro to path integral formulation. I'll introduce something more on this part later. But now I'll let you know, why do I even think of having some relation between these two disjoint fields? Cool!! -->

                Now here I will highlight my second result which is totally dedicated to Double copy formalism. I will highlight this result on behalf of the works by the group Jan Plefka and Zvi Bern. They studied this formalism on behalf of Gravitational Physics and they did use the formalism in case of gravitational scattering matrix. Then I will motivate my readers to Gravitational physics and its discovery and future goals. I wonder whether people will get engaged with my readings considering the advancement in this subject area. I am highly motivated in this direction and I wish my readers to feel the same as well. One my friend is an active researcher in this field of research, where they study the EFT methods to find the higher order PN corrections to Binary mergers. I am right now interested in the similar direction, not in particular. However in EOB and PN-PM approximation techniques. Recently I discovered one new field of line which is dedicated to Worldline quantum field theory. Now I have to learn this technique to understand how classical double copy relation is applied in case of World line quantum field theory. These are the works from Zvi Bern's group. They mostly work opposite to the work my friend does. They are computing the results based on the quantum field theory. Withing a month I have to learn this technique and include this in

              Keep it up with the website for fun and add some youtube channels in the PROBE section of the website. 
              There is something on the MUSICAL Path Integral in the blog for this month. Have to work on that too. 
              Let's start something here itself:
              Musics- Everybody is familiar with is this. But what is path integral? People apart from the physics community are not familiar to this terminologies. It;s interesting to mix up or you can say have a collaboration between these two woldwide popular fields. Seems to have fun!!
              Path integral has some technicalities associated with it. Mostly in physics. Discovered by Richard Feynman and introduced to the great community of Physics and solved many unsolved problems of physics using this particular path integral formalism. This is and intro to path integral formulation. I'll introduce something more on this part later. But now I'll let you know, why do I even think of having some relation between these two disjoint fields? Cool!! -->
